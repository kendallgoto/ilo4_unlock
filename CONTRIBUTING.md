There aren't really any hard rules here! If you have some additional research, please make a PR / reach out to me and I'd love to chat about it.

If you'd like to chat about my research, need help getting something setup, etc., please reach out and I'm happy to help.

For the sake of maintaining a dependable `main` and due to the vulnerability of generating iLO patches, please fully document any patches in PRs so that I can adaquetly vet & test them. Submitted code should never include HP intellectual property -- i.e., no binaries!

Please submit PRs against the `dev` branch.
